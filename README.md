# utils

A collection of `Mathematica` tools I often use in my research.

* `utils.m` an utility belt with general purpose functions. Inspired by
  [alibrary](https://github.com/magv/alibrary)
* `exterior.m` an implementation of the exterior algebra
* `cmats.m` an implementation of companion matrices
* `fftensor.m` tensor tools for
  [FiniteFlow](https://github.com/peraro/finiteflow)

Documentation will be added one day.
